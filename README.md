# Sudoku Solver: Implementation Of DSA algorithm

This C++ project is a Sudoku solver that implements a backtracking algorithm to solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. The solver ensures that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains unique numbers from 1 to 9. The algorithm efficiently checks the validity of potential number placements using constraints and backtracks when necessary. The project demonstrates key concepts like recursion, backtracking, and constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).

## Tech Stack Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Libraries: STL (Standard C++ functionality)
  
## Features
- Backtracking Algorithm: Solves Sudoku puzzles efficiently using recursive backtracking to explore valid number placements.

- Validation Checks: Ensures each number placement adheres to Sudoku rules (row, column, and subgrid constraints).

- Display Solutions: Prints the solved Sudoku grid and checks if a valid solution exists.

## Learning Goals

- Backtracking & Recursion: Improve understanding of backtracking algorithms and recursive programming techniques.

- Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Gain experience solving constraint satisfaction problems and applying rule-based validation.

- Debugging & Optimization: Enhance debugging skills and learn to optimize recursive algorithms for performance.
